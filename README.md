# Segmentation of Skeletal Stem Cells Nuclei in Phase Contrast Images

This is the repository containing the files for the project work of
the [Advanced Machine Learning for Physics course](https://elearning.uniroma1.it/enrol/index.php?id=16240)
(AY 2022/2022) at Sapienza University of Rome taught by prof. Stefano Giagu.

## Content of the repository

The repository contains:
- the `assets` folder containing images used in the notebooks
- the `SSCNuclei_Project.ipynb` Jupyter notebook containing the code for loading the data, preparing the model and training it.

## Impressum

The lab work has been performed by Antonio Culla, Domenico Caudo, Biagio Palmisano and Shoichi Yip.

The segmentation process has been devised by Shoichi Yip.

The project was coordinated by Stefania Melillo and Leonardo Parisi.

This project belongs to the ERC RG.BIO project of the CoBBS Lab (Collective Behaviour in Biological Systems Laboratory) at CNR ISC - Sapienza.
